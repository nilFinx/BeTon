The icons used in this project were created by zuMi. They were either used in their original form or edited in an unprofessional manner—but at least it works ;) Source: https://hvif-store.art/

I created the BeTon app icon as raster icon (converted it to SVG and then to HVIF) as a placeholder until we have a better one.
